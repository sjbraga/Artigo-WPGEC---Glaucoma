  abstract  = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

OCT uses low-coherence interferometry to produce a two-dimensional image of optical scattering from internal tissue microstructures in a way that is analogous to ultrasonic pulse-echo imaging. OCT has longitudinal and lateral spatial resolutions of a few micrometers and can detect reflected signals as small as approximately 10(-10) of the incident optical power. Tomographic imaging is demonstrated in vitro in the peripapillary area of the retina and in the coronary artery, two clinically relevant examples that are representative of transparent and turbid media, respectively.},

  abstract = {The papers in this special section focus on the technology and applications supported by deep learning. Deep learning is a growing trend in general data analysis and has been termed one of the 10 breakthrough technologies of 2013. Deep learning is an improvement of artificial neural networks, consisting of more layers that permit higher levels of abstraction and improved predictions from data. To date, it is emerging as the leading machine-learning tool in the general imaging and computer vision domains. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be powerful tools for a broad range of computer vision tasks. Deep CNNs automatically learn mid-level and high-level abstractions obtained from raw data (e.g., images). Recent results indicate that the generic descriptors extracted from CNNs are extremely effective in object recognition and localization in natural images. Medical image analysis groups across the world are quickly entering the field and applying CNNs and other deep learning methodologies to a wide variety of applications. },

  abstract  = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained remarkable success in computer vision, which is mostly owe to their ability that enables learning rich image representations from large-scale annotated data. In the field of medical image analysis, large amounts of annotated data may be not always available. The number of acquired ground-truth data is sometimes insufficient to train the CNNs without overfitting and convergence issues from scratch. Hence application of the deep CNNs is a challenge in medical imaging domain. However, transfer learning techniques are shown to provide solutions for this challenge. In this paper, our target task is to implement diabetic retinopathy fundus image classification using CNNs based transfer learning. Experiments are performed on 1014 and 1200 fundus images from two publicly available DR1 and MESSIDOR datasets. In order to complete the target task, we carry out experiments using three different methods: 1) fine-tuning all network layers of each of different pre-trained CNN models; 2) fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model in a layer-wise manner; 3) using pre-trained CNN models to extract features from fundus images, and then training support vector machines using these features. Experimental results show that convolutional neural networks based transfer learning can achieve better classification results in our task with small datasets (target domain), by taking advantage of knowledge learned from other related tasks with larger datasets (source domain). Transfer learning is a promising technique that promotes the use of deep CNNs in medical field with limited amounts of data.},

Many studies have evaluated and compared the diagnostic accuracies of a variety of parameters that can be obtained from imaging these areas of the ocular fundus.

characteristic structural changes in the optic nerve head reflected
in the visual field. The visual-field sensitivity test is commonly used
in a clinical setting to evaluate glaucoma. Standard automated
perimetry (SAP) is a common computerized visual-field test
whose output is amenable to machine learning. We compared
the performance of a number of machine learning algorithms
with STATPAC indexes mean deviation, pattern standard deviation,
and corrected pattern standard deviation. The machine
learning algorithms studied included multilayer perceptron
(MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and linear (LDA) and
quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Parzen window, mixture
of Gaussian (MOG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG).
MLP and SVM are classifiers that work directly on the decision
boundary and fall under the discriminative paradigm. Generative
classifiers, which first model the data probability density and
then perform classification via Bayes� rule, usually give deeper
insight into the structure of the data space. We have applied
MOG, MGG, LDA, QDA, and Parzen window to the classification
of glaucoma from SAP. Performance of the various classifiers was
compared by the areas under their receiver operating characteristic
curves and by sensitivities (true-positive rates) at chosen
specificities (true-negative rates). The machine-learning-type
classifiers showed improved performance over the best indexes
from STATPAC. Forward-selection and backward-elimination
methodology further improved the classification rate and also has
the potential to reduce testing time by diminishing the number of
visual-field location measurements.},
